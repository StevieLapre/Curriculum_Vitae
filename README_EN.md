# Curriculum Vitae

Welcome to my **Online Curriculum Vitae**! This project is an interactive and modern website that presents my professional background, skills, courses, and ambitions. It replaces my traditional PDF resume and offers a dynamic experience for visitors.
Additionally, I am always intrigued by the latest trends in software techniques and like to apply them to my personal projects.
Think of AI, Quantum technology, Development, Automation, etc.
