                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">My journey so far has been a rollercoaster of experiences, challenges, and growth. I have had the opportunity to work with some amazing people, learn from the best, and grow as a professional. Here is a brief overview of my journey so far.</p>
                <h2>My career in logistics and sales (2006 - 2020)</h2>
                    <h3>Logistics Employee | De Mandemakers Groep (2006 - 2016)</h3>
                    <p> My career started in logistics at <em>De Mandemakers Groep</em>, where I was responsible for loading trucks, checking products and preparing orders for shipment. 
                    In this role, I gained broad experience with logistics processes, such as order processing, transport planning, goods management and export/expedition.
                    During ten years, I learned the ins and outs of the sector and developed a strong sense of accuracy and efficiency.
                    In order to deepen my logistics knowledge, I followed the <strong>MBO2 Logistics Employee training (2010 - 2011)</strong> via <em>ROC Midden Nederland</em> during this period.
                    Here I learned the basic principles of logistics processes such as order picking, inventory and stock management. 
                    Because I wanted more responsibility, I subsequently followed the <strong>MBO3 Logistics Team Leader training (2011 - 2012)</strong> via <em>ROC Midden Nederland</em>.
                    This training gave me insight into team management, warehouse layout and administrative processes.

                    <h3>Logistics Employee | FPE Seals (2016 - 2018)</h3>
                    After my time at <em>DMG</em>, I made the switch to <em>FPE Seals</em>, where I could further develop my logistics skills. 
                    Here the focus was on accurately measuring products in different units, processing orders and providing customer service at the physical counter. 
                    My technical insight and eye for detail came in handy in the hydraulic sector, where precision is of great importance.

                    <h3>Logistics Teamlead | FPE Seals (2018 - 2020)</h3>
                    Shortly afterwards, I was given the opportunity to progress to the position of <strong>Logistics Teamlead</strong> within <em>FPE Seals</em>. 
                    In this role, I was responsible for coordinating the logistics process, including order picking, processing and shipping. 
                    I also helped with the reorganization of the warehouse to improve efficiency. 
                    This was a valuable experience in which I not only sharpened my leadership skills, but also worked with tools such as Adobe and Excel for inventory management and reporting.

                    <h3>Sales Trainee | FPE Seals (Aug 2020 - Oct 2020)</h3>
                    Looking for new challenges, I made the switch to the sales department as a <strong>Sales Trainee</strong>. 
                    Here the focus was on customer contact, order processing and product service. 
                    I had the opportunity to support both regular and new customers and process their requests efficiently. 
                    I also learned to recognize and advise on catalog products based on customer needs. 
                    This role gave me valuable commercial experience and strengthened my communication skills.
                    <br><br><br>

                    <h3>Switch to IT (2020 - present)</h3>
                    Although I learned many valuable lessons in logistics and sales, my passion for IT continued to grow. 
                    In my spare time, I delved more and more into software and technology, which eventually led to a conscious career switch towards the IT sector. 
                    The skills I developed in logistics and sales—such as problem-solving, customer focus and process optimization—I still use in my current work as an IT specialist.</p>
