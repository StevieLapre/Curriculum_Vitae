                <h2>Let me introduce myself</h2>
                I am <strong>Stevie Lapré</strong>, born on <strong>August 15, 1987</strong> in <strong>Waalwijk</strong> and raised in the <strong>Zanddonk district</strong>.
                <br><br>

                I have been fascinated by technology from an early age. As a child of the <em>90's</em>, I experienced almost the entire <em>digital revolution</em>.
                <br>

                It all started at home with the <strong>Atari and the Sega Master System – computers</strong> that first brought entertainment through digital games.
                The possibility to lose yourself in a <strong>virtual world</strong> that was specially developed for the consumer marked the beginning of the digital revolution for me.
                <br><br>

                New consoles soon followed: <em>the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), N64, Nintendo GameCube, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Switch</em>, and the entire range of <em>PlayStations (1, 2, 3)</em> and <em>Xbox consoles (Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X)</em>.
                <br>
                
                In addition to consoles, I also became increasingly fascinated by <strong>PC's</strong> and at a later stage <strong>laptop devices</strong>. 
                <br><br>

                The rapid technological progress made me <em>curious</em> and challenged me to learn more. I started opening up <em>hardware</em> and taught myself how to get computers working again after assembly.
                That same <strong>curiosity</strong> also led me to <em>software</em>. 
                I discovered that the <em>digital revolution</em> was entering a new era, and I decided to fully join in.

                <h2>80's/90's 20th Century</h2>
                As the years went by, I started to delve more deeply into computers and laptops. 
                <br>
                This gave me a better understanding of how systems work and how hardware communicates with each other. 
                <br>
                Despite still being active in the logistics sector, I got to know and understand different systems.
                <br><br><br>

                <h2>21th Century</h2>
                Nowadays I am active in the ICT sector.
                <br>
                Five years ago, due to circumstances, I left the logistics sector behind and decided to focus entirely on a career as an IT professional.
                <br><br><br> 

                <img src="../media/images/00's.jpeg" alt="About" style="width:60%; height: auto;" loading="lazy">
                <br><br><br>
                
                <h2>My Personal Life</h2>
                Besides my career, I also have a normal <em>family life</em> that I enjoy every day.
                <br>
                I met my wife in <em>2001</em> through friends. 
                In <em>2006</em> we started a relationship and started our life together happily. 
                In <strong>2012</strong> we got married and in <strong>2013</strong> our life was enriched with a beautiful <em>son</em>.
                <br>
                That year we also bought our house in Waalwijk, where we have since built a warm and loving home together.
                <br><br><br>

                <h2>Hobbies & Interest</h2>
                In addition to my career, I also have a variety of hobbies.
                Although I want to be active in the tech world professionally, I am an outdoors person at home.
                I like to go <strong>fishing</strong> and explore new places. Traveling is a great way for me to explore the world. 
                Of course, you can watch everything online via live streams, but nothing beats the experience of experiencing it yourself.
                <br><br>

                I also like to enjoy a <strong>good party with friends</strong>, to let loose and have fun after all the hard work. 
                However, I can also be a bit introverted sometimes. 
                For example, I regularly play board games with friends, where we challenge and further develop our cognitive skills.
                <br><br>

                I also regularly watch <strong>anime series and movies</strong>, purely out of interest and to stay open-minded. 
                Discovering different <em>languages ​​and cultures</em> fascinates me. 
                Just as computer languages ​​have their own structure and logic, so do world languages, each with their own unique structure and spelling.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Cooking</strong> is another passion of mine.
                In my culture, they say: <em>'If you can't cook, you shouldn't live on your own.' </em>
                That's why I think it's important to cook fresh and healthy food every day. 
                Combining good food and <em>exercise</em> is essential for a healthy life.
                <br><br>

                In addition to holidays, I also like to go to <strong>amusement parks</strong> with my family. 
                My son loves it and as he gets older, the world we can discover together grows. 
                It's a passion that I like to share with him, no matter how old I get.
                <br><br>

                I'm also still a bit of the <strong>'Tech Guy'</strong> of the neighborhood.
                I'm especially known to <em>older</em> people and those who are less interested in technology. 
                Several times a month they ask me if I can help them with technical problems, repairs or advice. 
                This can be about all kinds of IT-related matters, and I like to help them get everything working again.
                <br><br>

                This neighborhood help even led to me being asked to look at my son's sports club to see if there were any improvements possible in the field of IT & technology. 
                Since last year I've been doing this as a hobby, not only to help individuals, but also to give clubs more exposure.
                This experience helped me to obtain my <strong>HBO module</strong>, partly thanks to the collaboration with the association.
                We are currently still working on further optimizing everything.
                <br><br>

                In addition, I always stay up to date with <strong>latest gadgets and tech trends</strong>, so that I know what is going on and can continuously improve my <em>knowledge</em>.
                <strong>Self-study and education remain important to me.</strong>
                I continue to educate myself in the field of IT and technology to explore the world as much as possible and to further expand my knowledge.
